= Associations

== Reusing associations

When defining multiple, similar sync-actions, the same field mappers and esp. the same `associations` are often used.
To reuse such `associations`, define `common` mappings in the `settings.yml`.
It is good practice indicating the direction of the mapping.

[source,yaml]
----
include::../../../framework/src/test/resources/settings.yml[tag=reuse-association]
----

The common entries can then be used by setting a *#common* association pointing to the entry name.

[source,yaml]
----
include::../../../framework/src/test/resources/settings.yml[tag=MultiSelectionFieldMapper]
----

By adding `-&gt;reversed` to the entry, the map is reversed.

[source,yaml]
----
include::../../../framework/src/test/resources/settings.yml[tag=MultiSelectionFieldMapper-reversed]
----

If the imported common entries should be extended, you can simply define more definitions to it.
Additional you can also simply add multiple common entries.
