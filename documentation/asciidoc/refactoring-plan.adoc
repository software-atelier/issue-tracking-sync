= Refactoring Plan

== Current situation

There are no submodules defined.
The software is structured in packages.

plantuml::resources/level1-Variante_0.puml[]

Issues::
* Project cannot build at GitHub
* -> no quality check at GitHub
* -> no doc-as-code can be provided
* Users needs to get atlassian and rtc libraries
* -> So OS project is quite unusable for foreign

<<<

== Plan A

Split into submodules.
Opensource and customized parts are separated.

plantuml::resources/level1-Variante_A.puml[]

Benefits::
* Open source part can be built at GitHub
* Foreigners can see how to customize
* doc-as-code can be built at GitHub

<<<

== Plan B

Split into submodules.
Opensource and customized parts are separated.
Customized parts are moved to Loepa repository.


plantuml::resources/level1-Variante_B.puml[]

Benefits::
