This tool synchronizes issues between https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira[Atlassian JIRA] and https://jazz.net/products/rational-team-concert/[IBM RTC].
Synchronisation is configured field-per-field in one YAML file.
The tool runs as a small web server to allow for processing of (JIRA) webhook calls.
